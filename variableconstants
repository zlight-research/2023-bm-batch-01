# difference between variable and constants?

# Python Variables
    # a variable is a storage area to hold data. For example,
    #   number = 10 (number is the variable storing the value 10)



# Python Constants

    # A constant is a special type of variable whose value cannot be changed.In Python, constants are usually declared and assigned in a module (a new file containing variables, functions, etc which is imported to the main file).

# declare constants 
PI = 3.14
GRAVITY = 9.8

# Create a main.py:

# import constant file we created above
# import constant
# print(constant.PI) # prints 3.14
# print(constant.GRAVITY) # prints 9.8
# In the above example, we created the constant.py module file. Then, we assigned the constant value to PI and GRAVITY.
# After that, we create the main.py file and import the constant module. Finally, we printed the constant value.
