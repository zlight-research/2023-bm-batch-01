3)Difference between variable and constants ?
VARIBLE-a variable is a value that is changing or that has the ability to change. 
CONSTANT-A constant is a value that remains unchanged.
The key difference between constants and variables is that constants are fixed values and variables are varying values in an algebraic expression.
