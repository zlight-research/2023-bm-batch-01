# Difference between variable and constants ?
# constant
#   A constant does not change its value over time.
#   It have fixed face value
# varaible
# changes its value depend on the equation
# it have not fixed values

# Example to explain
x=1
X=2
print(x)  
# in smal letter become VARAIBLE  
print(X)
# in capital letter become CONSTANT
