#A constant is a named data item with a predefined value, while a variable is a named data item whose value can change during the course of program execution

Constant: A constant can be defined as a fixed value, which is used in algebraic expressions and equations. A constant does not change over time and has a fixed value. For example, the size of a shoe or cloth or any apparel will not change at any point.

In an algebraic equation, x+y = 8, 8 is a constant value, and it cannot be changed.

Variables: Variables are terms which can change or vary over time. Its value does not remain constant, unlike constants. For example, the height and weight of a person do not always remain constant, and hence they are variables.

In an algebraic equation, x+y = 8, x and y are the variables whose values can be changed.

Let us figure out the other key differences between constants and variables.
